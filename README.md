# Personalized Fashion Recommendations

The midpoint notebook contains the preprocessing techniques and clustering methods implemented.

Implementation is present at

`Data_Cleaning.ipynb`: Contains the preprocessing techniques and clustering methods implemented.

`Kmeans.ipynb`: Contains the Kmeans clustering and recommendation system implementation.

`LGBM_KNN.ipynb`: Contains the LGBM and KNN recommendation system implementation.

`Metrics.ipynb`: Contains the evaluation metrics for the recommendation system.

Hereâ€™s a list of the libraries used in the notebook along with the installation instructions.
